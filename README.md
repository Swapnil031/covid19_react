# Introduction COVID-19 Tracker

<a href="https://swapnil031.github.io/covid19_react/"><B><u>Live Demo - COVID-19 Tracker</u></B></a> 

A web application which helps in keeping track of number of total cases, recovered cases and number of deaths due to COVID-19. 

The application fetches live data from API and plots graphs for the number of cases. Records for individual countries can also be visualized.

Here I have used React for developing the application, Chart.JS for plotting graphs and Material UI for importing UI elements.

As a beginner, I undertook and completed this project to have a strong understanding of React's workflow and the use of hooks.
