# Introduction COVID-19 Tracker

<a href=""><B>Live Demo</a> - COVID-19 Tracker</B> 

A web application which helps in keeping track of number of total cases, recovered cases and number of deaths due to COVID-19. 

The application fetches live data from API and plots graphs for the number of cases. Records for individual countries can also be visualized.

Here I have used React for developing the application, Chart.JS for plotting graphs and Material UI for importing UI elements.

<a href="https://reactjs.org/"><B>React</a> - </B> An open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies and used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

As a beginner, I undertook and completed this project to have a strong understanding of React's workflow and the use of hooks.
