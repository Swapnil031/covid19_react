# COVID-19 Tracker

## Introduction
A web application which helps in keeping track of number of total cases, recovered cases and number of deaths due to COVID-19. 

The application fetches live data from API and plots graphs for the number of cases. Records for individual countries can also be visualized.

Here I have used React for developing the application, Chart.JS for plotting graphs and Material UI for importing UI elements.
